19:07:24 Okay. I think caption is on. Okay, so thank you so much for agreeing to participate in our technology innovation study today really young.
19:07:32 So my name is Daniel Fahmy. And I'm conducting research as part of our team project at the University of Melbourne.
19:07:39 The main aim of our project is to better understand the practical and social challenges international students like you pace during their adjustment to life at the university and ultimately to explore the potential of designing a technological solution to address these challenges.
19:07:56 During this semi-structured interview. Which will take approximately 15 to 20 minutes. I will ask you some questions about your personal experience and your opinions on current technological tools.
19:08:06 Or services that may support you. There are no right or wrong answers. They are simply interested in your experience, thoughts and insights.
19:08:14 You may choose to stop the interview at any point of time and your responses will be kept confidential and used only for the purpose of our recession.
19:08:22 So do you have any questions before we begin? All right.
19:08:26 No? All good.
19:08:30 So can you please briefly introduce yourself, maybe your year of study, your course.
19:08:36 And your country of origin.
19:08:39 Yep, I'm brilliant. So I have an undergraduate in computer science from malaysia But then I went to Melbourne to do my master's in information system at the University of Melbourne.
19:08:54 I… I first arrived in Melbourne in January 2023 And just recently graduated in December 2024.
19:09:06 Yeah, so that pretty much sums up about me in terms of my education experience currently i'm now back in Malaysia and yeah working at Kuala Lumpa
19:09:15 Okay. Okay, so congratulations for your graduation and also for your job so um Could you share a bit about why you chose to study at the University of Melbourne?
19:09:25 Thank you.
19:09:30 Because in melbourne we have a lot of well reputed universities So why do you choose Unity of Melbourne?
19:09:53 Okay.
19:09:41 It goes all the way back to why Melbourne first First, when I decided to study in Australia, I look up at the cities that are funded to study at Melbourne was on the top of the list because it's one of the most livable city in the world
19:09:59 Also, it has a lot of well-established institutes educational institutes there.
19:10:08 Mm-hmm.
19:10:06 When I scope down. University of Melbourne was by far the most reputable and also highest ranked University in Melbourne itself and also it has the cost that I was looking for so Naturally.
19:10:25 Decided to apply for my master's with the University of Melbourne.
19:10:31 Okay. Okay. Thank you. I'm trying not to be biased, but I couldn't agree more.
19:10:36 So, um. Okay, so next, how would you describe your experience of a as a previous international student at the University of Melbourne.
19:10:49 Um… I would say that University of Melbourne has quite a diverse group of students.
19:10:58 Whereby you get to meet people from different countries. Personally, I've met people from China, Indonesia, Timo-Leste.
19:11:06 To Lomont Island as well. It gave me a very good international exposure as in meeting people that I will not have a chance to meet if I were to stay in Kuala And the second thing is that the educational experience that i had in melbourne
19:11:27 They not only focus on the technical aspects or the educational part but They also support us in terms of called curriculum activities like there are a lot of events hosted by gsa Also, we are encouraged to be volunteers like the Melbourne peer mentor and also to help out during the open day
19:11:48 Mm-hmm. Okay, so besides the GSA, is there any other example Can you share a specific situation that illustrates your experience?
19:12:03 Hmm. What kind of experience, just to be clear
19:12:09 Of your experience as international student trying to integrate into Australian culture, I would say.
19:12:17 Okay. Yeah. So for my case, before I arrived in austria.
19:12:23 I mean, when I first arrived in Melbourne, I had to go through um what we call like uh integration uh cost intro introductory cost sorry whereby we were given the opportunity to learn more about Australian culture And also Australia history
19:12:53 Mm-hmm.
19:12:45 But I can't say the same for others because for my case it was part of Australian government's program for the scholars which i think personally it was beneficial for me because I get to understand more about the country and what to expect for the next two years
19:13:03 Before I officially start my classroom So I think that was a advantage for me
19:13:12 Okay, interesting. Okay, so… thinking about some of the expectation you had before arriving to Australia.
19:13:22 How have those match your actual experience?
19:13:28 Hmm. Reflecting back.
19:13:34 I thought that is pretty much what I've expected from my expectation.
19:13:43 For me, the most important part is about networking, meeting new people I managed to do so during my time there.
19:13:52 At the same time, I was also looking forward to expand my soft skills like communication skill leadership skill I think that the curriculum itself was very well-rounded whereby provided me with the opportunity to do so.
19:14:09 Mm-hmm. All right. Interesting. So, um.
19:14:14 I'll move to the next question. So since arriving at the University of Melbourne.
19:14:20 What practical or social challenges have you encountered?
19:14:26 Hmm. Probably, I think a lot of students face problem with finding a right place to stay.
19:14:36 Oh.
19:14:47 Yeah, yeah.
19:14:35 Housing is the main problem. Yeah, I think for Malaysians we are lucky because we have a Malaysia hall to to like temporary slave but I have… Even with that, it also took me three months to find a place to stay.
19:14:56 That's also the same case for a lot of our classmates They either had Malaysia horses so they had to stay in hotel for a few weeks before they they find a permanent place to stay So I think that was the biggest challenge for me as a student
19:15:11 And the second challenge for me was in terms of expenses everything in australia is so much more expensive when compared to Malaysia like eating out utility bills.
19:15:26 Even the telephone bills is also much more expensive Yeah. So I said these are the two main challenges for me.
19:15:34 Okay. Okay. All right. So… did these challenges how did these challenges affect your daily life your studies can you elaborate?
19:15:47 For the first few months of my study i was technically going out for house inspection almost every day I have to travel from east of the way to west of melbourne I've lost count how many… inspection I've ran uh how many cover letter i've wrote for the house application
19:16:10 I think there was a kind of distracting from my study at least to say so.
19:16:17 And… On top of that, I was also looking for a part-time job going for interviews so these two things were actually keeping me quite occupied for my first semester of study actually
19:16:35 Okay. Okay. So with regards to the challenges and also your your difficult experience particularly in finding houses and as well as finding a part-time job So how do you address or manage these challenges?
19:16:54 How do you get to it?
19:17:00 So I would… say that I try to be more systematic whereby i would only go for house inspection where I think it interests me.
19:17:16 And also have higher chance of getting it. So I don't… go to every house inspection that I find as compared to when I first arrived with Melbourne.
19:17:28 Same goes for the job application as well. So that makes… the process of attending house inspection or writing cover letters more manageable At the same time, I also reached out to my connections, asking my friends If they have any recommendation on finding a place to stay
19:17:51 For those that who got it do some like knowledge sharing any tips and tricks how they talk to the agent or talk to the house owner Also, I try to spread around my difficulties like i tell my friend and then like
19:18:07 Have been like, I'm having this problem like if you guys know someone who is renting out please let me know So yeah, I think…
19:18:18 Not to say sharing my load with my connection, but rather expressing the challenges that i have actually made it more easier for me to manage as well.
19:18:29 Yeah. All right. All right. Okay. Yep.
19:18:34 Okay, so… Have you used any specific tools?
19:18:40 Apps, platforms or services provided either by the university or external sources to support you during your transition and adjustment.
19:18:48 Overcome the challenges.
19:18:55 So… I can't say for other students but like for our scholarship we have a community among all the scholars whereby we can reach out to the officer in charge of us or other scholars if we face any difficulties during our time here.
19:19:16 So I say that that was one of the main platform that I use when i first arrive.
19:19:25 But also through this scholarship program, I managed to establish connections with a lot of people whereby we have peer support to help us with the transitioning
19:19:41 Okay. Okay. Um Have you used any university provided uh tools um like stop one or maybe CAPS.
19:19:57 Cips stands for counseling and psychological support services.
19:20:04 By the University of Melbourne. Any other submissions.
19:20:09 Stop one, yes, in terms of cost planning not for transitioning, I would say.
19:20:16 So when I arrived, I was a bit uh unsure of what are the subjects that I should take because there are so many options compared to malaysia where the colliculum is already fixed part in Melbourne.
19:20:31 We have the flexibility of choosing our subjects, when to take it, what are the subject to take it So I was confused.
19:20:38 At first so i went to the stock one and then i talk to the officer in there to get advice on how should I plan for my course
19:20:51 How about a student organization? Do you have any experience uh with them involving them.
19:21:00 Personally, I'm involved with TSA. So I was the faculty counsellor for our faculty.
19:21:11 Okay.
19:21:11 So I… had the opportunity to work with the team on how we can better support the students transitioning to uni life One of the main problem was that the student when they first arrived, they have no friend So we did a lot of like social activities like uh
19:21:55 Oh.
19:21:36 Free lunch, free breakfast or festival events to connect students together I also attended Amsu international's event uh like uh like the how to say body up program whereby we are paired up with new friends I think… the student organizations were very helpful in terms of helping us to establish
19:22:06 Connections with other students.
19:22:10 Okay. Okay. So… thinking about all the challenges you have mentioned.
19:22:17 So in what ways do you think technology could potentially help you overcome or better to manage these challenges?
19:22:25 So um yeah dialect here is technology maybe apps or digital solution.
19:22:46 Yep.
19:22:36 If I were to reflect on the main issue that students face um would be not having a friend when they first arrive in Melbourne So having an app that helps us to connect potentially connect with our future classmates uh
19:22:53 Or… or maybe a hobby group like maybe we can already meet people who like badminton Or maybe someone who has a common interest I already studying in in the same university like our senior who is already studying in Melbourne where we can reach out to to get advice
19:23:17 That would be helpful.
19:23:20 That's a really interesting take. Yeah. So…
19:23:23 But in terms of housing i would I'll say it's a very tough challenge because we already have like real estate real estate website but the problem is not about the technology but rather the supply and demand in Melbourne.
19:23:43 I agree. Yep, that's true.
19:23:48 So… Could you describe any services that you wish existed during your study But I do not.
19:23:58 Do not actually exist.
19:24:02 The visa. Hmm.
19:24:05 Any services or apps You mentioned just now that you wish that there's like a body of tools or application which can like matchmaking between uh with people uh like-minded people as well as uh those who have a common interest.
19:24:22 So do you have any other apps that you wish it exists.
19:24:29 Hmm.
19:24:35 I can't think of anything at the moment.
19:24:39 It's okay. It's all right. Okay.
19:24:45 Okay, so in your opinion. What would make a technological tool appealing or valuable to international students like yourself?
19:25:01 Probably easy to use. So there's not much clicks.
19:25:04 Okay. Okay.
19:25:10 Also… I would see… Privacy.
19:25:18 I don't know why it's the istila, but…
19:25:22 Okay.
19:25:24 So it's like… When I want to meet someone from Melbourne University, I want to make sure that I'm meeting a real student from University of Melbourne. It's not like someone create a fake account acting that they are students, but they're actually not.
19:25:36 Oh. Okay, yeah, I think I got you. Maybe like a reliable It's not matchmaking you with some bots or catfish.
19:25:44 Yeah, reliable
19:25:51 Okay.
19:25:50 I think… probably like more like on personal safety as well so we don't end up meeting a stranger or bad people.
19:25:57 Oh, yeah. Yep. Okay, that really makes sense.
19:26:04 Okay. Okay, that's all actually that we have.
19:26:09 So thank you very much for your valuable insights and your time today. Your responses have given us a clearer picture of the practical and social challenges faced by international students like us.
