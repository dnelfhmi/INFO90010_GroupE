12:53:05 Hello there, how are you today?
12:53:11 Are you ready? Okay, before we jump in.
12:53:18 I'll give you an overall overview of what we are doing to do today.
12:53:22 The purpose of this research is to investigate challenges faced by International students at the University of Melbourne.
12:53:31 So we are investigating things like academic pressure, social integration as well as the cultural adaptation.
12:53:41 Here you will be taking part in the semi-structured interview, roughly about 10 to 15 minutes.
12:53:48 Where we'll talk about your experiences adjusting to university life, and also the challenges that you have accounted.
12:53:56 And your thoughts on… Probably digital tools that could support international students.
12:54:04 And what we're trying to do is we really want to understand how you currentlly manage local culture integration experineces here in Australia.
12:54:13 And your personal experience as an international student at University of Melbourne.
12:54:19 Basically, there are no right or wrong answers. And feel free to skip any questions, or stop at any time.
12:54:27 Is that okay with you? 
12:54:47 Yeah, sounds… sounds good.
12:55:09 Okay? Okay, awesome, man. Let's get started. Hmm, to begin.
12:55:18 Could you tell me a bit of about yourself? your major, your study year, and where you're from?
12:55:26 So, I'm originally from Hong Kong I'm in my second year of the master of information system, MIS, here at UniMelb.
12:55:38 Great. So, what's your current living situation here in Melbourne?
12:55:43 Sorry, what do you mean? 
12:55:43 So, where do you live?
12:55:46 Are you renting? 
12:55:46 Ohhh yes yes yeah, I'm renting. So I'm renting in a studio near Footscray Station.
12:55:50 So how is it so far?
12:55:54 It's okay for campus. And the city, and also is quite compact.
12:56:00 Basically, when you first arrive, how did you find How did you go about finding that place?
12:56:09 Um, to be honest, it was pretty challenging. I used real estate and a few Facebook groups.
12:56:16 I messaged few landlords. And, um, I think half of the listings were outdated.
12:56:23 Okay, that was… must be stressful for you, right? But, what were your priorities at that time?
12:56:33 Is it rent? Is it the commute time? Or is it just… Safety.
12:56:39 Rent was top of my list because my scholarship only covers so much.
12:56:43 I also wanted to get a place about less than 30 minutes to campus.
12:56:49 By train or tram and renting in a neighborhood that I can feel safe.
12:56:54 So, do you get any help from the University's support system?
12:56:58 Um, actually, I remember I emailed one of the new social clubs.
12:57:05 Finally got a PDF guide. I ended up relying on Hong Kong or my home country alumni group for tips.  
12:57:05 Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, so… If you had a tool that… showcase average rent or commute time.Or community vibe. How useful would that be? 
12:57:36 Uh, I feel like it is gonna be extremely useful. Because picking up a suburb with no idea of the crowd or the local community.
12:57:43 Or even the cost. It could be quite overwhelming.
12:57:48 Okay, that's nice. And, um… Uh, thank you for the insights. For the sake of time, I believe we better get going on to our next topic.
12:57:54 So, could you tell me about your typical weekly schedule? 
12:58:06 Right. I wake up at 7… I grabbed cereal, or toast. Usually, and I catch the… train, um, around 8:20 to campus. Um, and… I have lectures, usually in the morning until noon.
12:58:22 Then I will get… lunch with my classmates, and then… I'll will be attending go some tutorials, usually in the afternoon, and… Before I go back in the evening, I'm gonna study at the library.
12:58:41 Do you, do you… work part-time or engage in extracurriculars?
12:58:48 Basically, I did some tutoring, so I tutor online for some high school students.
12:58:54 Sometimes in the evening. I was planning to join some of the clubs here on campus, but I never managed to join one.
12:59:03 Oh, amazing. So… How do you field balancing study, work, and social life.
12:59:11 Um, to be honest with you, it's tricky. Assignments can demand a lot of hours per week, and I sometimes sacrifice some of the social events.
12:59:26 Okay, have you used any apps or calendar to manage your workload and events?
12:59:34 I use Google Calendar, and I also do my own to-do list. I manually, um… enter the deadlines. Which can be… quite tedious.
12:59:49 So, um, So, let's talk abou the effort, or the process of you… making friends and close partners, right?
13:00:00 How do you usually meet people in your… major, or in your courses?
13:00:08 Usually in lectures. I brave myself, I would say hi to someone sitting next to me and we also have some… WhatsApp groups for our projects.
13:00:25 But basically, it's mainly for assignment reminders. And when we want to catch up some project progress, and also for memes, though.
13:00:35 Do you think that… that kind of group helped you feel connected?
13:00:39 A little bit, but it's not great for genuine friendship. I usually prefer some coffee chats. I'd prefer some meet ups on campus. 
13:00:43 Okay, speaking of campus… Hmm, where do you like to work for your studies? 
13:00:58 I really like the first floor graduate space in FBE.
13:01:05 They have plenty of outlets, and also a bit peaceful. Cafes are also nice around campus, but can get noisy and also a bit expensive.
13:01:16 Have you tried booking… group study rooms on campus.
13:01:21 Yes, usually I book some of the the FBE rooms.
13:01:26 They got whiteboards and big tables, and it's perfect for our projects.
13:01:34 And at the same time, do you find it easy to build friendships over here?
13:01:40 Um, it's gotten better by… At the very start, I felt everyone stuck with their local high school friend groups.
13:01:50 So, breaking in was quite hard. 
13:01:58 And what kind of barriers do you face?
13:01:58 Homesickness plus some cultural differences in small talk. To be honest with you, I wasn't sure about joking or what topics were okay.
13:02:10 I see, thank you for sharing that. Now, can we move on to the next topic? 
13:02:13 Yeah, yeah, sure.
13:02:17 So now, we're gonna go about academic planning. How do you choose subjects?
13:02:23 Each semester usually, I just go to the, what do you call it, the university study plannner but at the same time I check prerequisites in the handbook. And then I asked friends, or I read… Reddit posts for advice on… or subject reviews.
13:02:47 It's very tough, because the info is pretty scattered.
13:02:50 I hear you
13:02:52 The feeling where you have so many options to take on.
13:02:57 What kind of subjects that you can take, but you don't know which subject that you're gonna love, or, um, you can only know once you actually enroll in that subject, right?
13:03:07 Absolutely. 
13:03:12 And,knowing some of the right info will actually help me to juggle work and study.
13:03:18 Have you ever chose subjects just because you know what kind of career, or what kind of future aspirations align with you?
13:03:29 I tried but, um, it was challenging, because to figure out which kind of subject that can actually develop me to the type of work I wanted.
13:03:44 Oh, yeah, I see. I understand the frustration, and it was not easy to know which subject is in… demand in the market right now, right?
13:03:53 Yeah, exactly. 
13:03:56 I think, um… We covered a bit of topics here.
13:04:02 So, thank you so much for the insight so far. Um, we're gonna go on to the next piece of topic.
13:04:11 So let's switch to general Digital Tools. Um, from your point of view, what makes you trust an app To be used by students?
13:04:22 Oh, that's easy. Officially university university endorsement. It's very important. And probably a community verified info, because a lot of apps out there people can be anonymous, and people can be mean. Users dont give 100% accurate reviews.
13:04:46 And, okay, that's a good point. So, what annoys you with all the apps around you?
13:04:55 Basically, I get frequent push notification. Complex sign-up space. Or ads. Those drive me away. 
13:04:59 Do you think that, any specific feature that you would love for? International students, so they can benefit from it. 
13:05:10 I really love to have a language exchange buddy finder, I guess. Probably something that can pair me with locals. Wanting to practice Cantonese or Mandarin. In exchange for um maybe Aussie slangs. 
13:05:23 Haha yes okay thank you so much. I think that was really helpful.
13:05:34 And before we wrap up, right, any practical stories or social challenges that you have faced here so far?
13:05:41 Uh, yeah, I think… let me recall… I think I have… one, um, I can't really remember right now.
13:05:48 So I once missed my… orientation sessions.It was, like, 2 years ago. Because the Google Map that I use, pointed it to the wrong building locations.
13:06:04 In terms of socially, I felt left out at events, when the locals were using Aussies slang. Which I did not understand initially. I guess a newcomer glossary or prompts will definitely help people like me. 
13:06:20 Okay, that's an amazing feedback. Thank you so much and we are almost 10 minutes in our interview. And do you have any final thoughts? 
13:06:30 I have nothing for my end at the moment.
13:06:37 Actually, there's one thing I would like to share. I just wish that I was more involved with school activities when I was in my first year.
13:06:45 Now, since I'm graduating in this semester, I felt that I've missed many good opportunities across the campus.
13:06:54 And, uh, I hope the research that you're currently doing? Actually can help international students especially, to get the best of their university life.
13:07:10 Thank you so much for your insights. Those are incredibly valuable. If you think of anything else.Just drop me an email.
13:07:24 I will definitely do. Thanks so much for your time. This was really helpful.
