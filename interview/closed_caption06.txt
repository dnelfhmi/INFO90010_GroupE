17:18:09 Okay? can you hear me? Okay, thank you. Right, um, so first of all, thank you for joining me today.
17:18:20 As mentioned, this is part of the research project that my team and I are currently conducting. Basically, we are focusing on trying to understand the social and practical challenges of an international student at the University of Melbourne. So, it will be, um… casual conversation.
17:18:48 And, nothing too formal. We, we'll… just walk through some of the challenges that you have faced.
17:19:00 Sure I'm happy to be here. I think it's… it's pretty good that team is doing this, There are a lot of stuff that doesn't get talked about.
17:19:16 Alright, thank you. So, let's start, um, with a bit of yourself. So, you don't have to mention your name.
17:19:24 You can just mention where you're originally from, the major that you are currently taking and how you are adjusting here in Melbourne?
17:19:32 Okay, so I'm from Thailand. I'm currently doing my Master's of information technology, specializing in computing.
17:19:47 So I move here earlier this year, with my wife and also our baby daughter.
17:19:54 Before this, I did my undergrad, in the US, in UCB.
17:20:01 Wow, okay, that's a big move. So, how is it, for you, how is it that you have been adjusting to life here?
17:20:11 Um, honestly, I thought it wouldn't be so difficult. Because I've had experience studying abroad before.
17:20:20 But, Melbourne has been very different. Especially the academic system.
17:20:29 May I ask in what way? 
17:20:35 So, for example, in the US, I believe that things were more structured.
17:20:41 There are weekly quizzes, and they are regular homework. Um, I truly believe that the US has more space for you to make mistakes because, for example, if you have 10 quizes, which… you need to do every week.
17:21:00 So they're gonna drop theor the lowest two quizzes. So… it gives you some sort of flexibility and more… holistic learning experience, while here at University of Melbourne.
17:21:14 You only have two major assignments, and if you, couldn't get, uh, to that threshold.
17:21:23 In your first assignment, and you failed the hurdle. You basically fail the subject.
17:21:31 It gave me some sort of anxiety, because I do believe that I have so much to lose. And basically, in UniMelb, we have fewer assessments.
17:21:47 And a lot of weight on each one. There was a shock at first.
17:21:52 I see, thank you for sharing that. So, did you feel prepared?
17:22:00 Not really, so I submitted my first assignment thinking that I did okay, but to be honest, I got much lower than expected.
17:22:10 I got good feedback, but I didn't realize how much critical thinking and referencing was needed.
17:22:19 Did you ask for help? 
17:22:22 I tried to talkto some of my, some of the students in my class.
17:22:27 But I do feel that… Um, there was a bit of a barrier.
17:22:34 Not just socially, but also with how I speak.
17:22:37 Is it because of your accent? 
17:22:41 I think so, yes. I've studied in English for years, but my accent is still Thai.
17:22:46 I noticed, uh, from my experience here. People are asking me to repeat myself quite often.
17:22:53 And sometimes they're just not… By lately, we're not really understanding.
17:23:00 That makes you anxious, and that makes you to hesitate to speak up.
17:23:07 Oh, okay. Did you experience that in the US too? 
17:23:07 Not as much, actually, in these states I believe that they was… much more diversity in the classrooms.
17:23:26 So, here I feel like there's a bit more of a gap between the domestic and international students 
17:23:33 Oh, I see, that must feel frustrating.
17:23:38 It is. So I've started participating more in online forum instead because I believe in that space, isn't a barrier for me from my English language perspective.
17:23:55 Okay, thank you for giving insights about the difficulty that you have faced. If you're okay,
17:24:08 Let's talk about housing, right? Since I know you mentioned you move here with your family? 
17:24:10 Sure. Um, I'm okay with that. Housing, that has been probably the hardest part.
17:24:24 Um, I couldn't go for share house like most students. We need our own space for the baby, for sleep routines. For privacy, basically finding a rental was a nightmare.
17:24:38 Is it because of the market? 
17:24:40 Yeah, because of the market as well as the perception.
17:24:44 I'm a student, so… Um, but that doesn't mean that I don't have… substantial savings. I do have, but even when I showed the agents, my bank balance.
17:25:00 Or for a few months upfront still, almost every application That I did. I got rejected.
17:25:06 Even with advanced payment. Yeah, I would say that they think that there's no source of income, or… it was too risky. For them to let a student with, um, two family members to rent the house.
17:25:28 Um, it didn't really matter that I wasn't asking for a discount, or that I was offering more rent in advance, I guess.
17:25:36 Student visa here in Melbourne is unreliable to some agents, right?
17:25:44 So how long did it take to find their place? 
17:25:51 For me, nearly… 3 months, so we stay in a service apartment, which was very expensive.
17:25:55 I was applying to up. To… 4 houses a day.
17:26:00 And I inspect… I inspected a lot during my lunch break.
17:26:05 And sometimes I carry my daughter in one arm. And document in other… 
17:26:09 That sounds incredibly challenging. 
17:26:15 It was, it was. And at one point, I thought, did I make a mistake bringing my family here?
17:26:20 It made me feel that I wasn't able to provide.
17:26:24 I'm sorry to hear that, that's really a heavy feeling to carry on to your study.
17:26:30 Yeah, that's where people assume. If you are here with your family, you must have it all figured out.
17:26:36 But still a student, and everything is hard there with a toddler.
17:26:40 So, what helped you get through it? 
17:26:45 My wife, my partner, honestly.
17:26:47 She kept us grounded. And once we finally move into our space, it's in Glen Iris.
17:26:55 I finally felt that I could breathe again. 
17:26:57 Are you settled in now?
17:27:00 More or less, so we are still learning things, like council rules, and how rubbish collection works.But we've got a routine now.
17:27:08 Alright, thank you for sharing that. So, um, let's move on to the next topic.
17:27:16 So how is your experience in class now compared to your first month?
17:27:20 Better, I have fled to adjust my writing to what is expected here.
17:27:25 I also had one tutor who took their time to explain feedback more clearly.
17:27:31 And that helped a lot. 
17:27:34 That's good to hear. Do you feel that there's enough support for international students with families?
17:27:39 Honestly, more. Honestly, no. So, most of the events and advice are tailored to students who are living alone or in dorms.
17:27:50 Um, I think I couldn't find any section that says something about studying with dependent.
17:27:57 Even small things like childcare option or health clinic, you have to dig it on your own. Yeah, there's a gap worth looking into.
17:28:06 Definitely, I think if there was a group or even a chat space for student parents.
17:28:12 That would really help us the team so much.
17:28:16 Home about tech or apps? Have you had any tools that help you manage your life here?
17:28:22 Not much, actually, so I use most of that time the email and digital technology services from UniMelb.
17:28:34 Nothing that reflects someone managing study, family, and finance all at once.
17:28:44 And If if someone were to develop a technological solution what will you want it to include?
17:28:51 I really want… an app that can filter housing option by family-friendliness. Advice on childcare, medical services, or even grocery discounts.
17:29:12 And a feature where you can connect with other students based on circumstances, not just course
17:29:16 I think that's a great suggestion.
17:29:22 I think there were feelings when you feel like you're the only one going through something. Just seeing someone post. I'm also doing this with my family, that is actually will… make a difference.
17:29:36 What has been a small win for you lately? 
17:29:43 That's a good question. So I think my daughter started sleeping through the night again.
17:29:49 And there was a big win for us. And, I got my first H1 last week, after everything that felt huge.
17:29:59 That's amazing, you should really be proud of. 
17:30:06 I don't talk about it much, but almost like that made me feel like okay, maybe I'm doing something right.
17:30:11 So, if you had one message, um, to another international student thinking of coming here with their family, what would you say?
17:30:19 I see, You need to plan more than you think you need to.
17:30:23 And don't assume saving would be enough. You need a support network as well.
17:30:31 Also, give yourself some time to adjust. It takes time to adjust to a new place, and every country is different, because even though I have experience living, in a different foreign place, but… coming here to Melbourne was totally a different experience.
17:30:55 That's powerful. Thank you for sharing all that so openly.
17:31:10 No worries! I'm happy to share.
17:31:15 Before we conclude, do you have any questions for me about our research or this interview process?
17:31:33 Nothing from my end. Thank you so much.
17:31:46 Thank you once again for your input. Your feedback and experience are highly appreciated and will help us develop meaningful innovation to support international students here at the University of Melbourne.
17:31:57 Have a great day. Thank you. Bye.
