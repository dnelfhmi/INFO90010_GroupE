17:02:11 Ah yeah, no problem. Thanks for inviting me.

17:02:14 Just to kick off, can you introduce yourself a little? Where you’re from, what you study, that kind of thing?

17:02:19 Yeah sure. Uh, I’m from Incheon, South Korea. I’m studying Master of Data Science, just started my second year this semester. It’s been, um, kind of intense, but also pretty interesting.

17:02:31 How are you finding it so far?

17:02:33 Yeah, the content’s good, but it’s… fast-paced. Like every week, there’s something due. I feel like I’m always trying to catch up, you know? Especially last semester, I got two heavy coding subjects and it was a bit too much.

17:02:46 And where are you living at the moment?

17:02:48 I’m in Carlton. Just ten minutes walk from uni, which is nice. I used to live further away with a relative when I first came here, but the commute was too long.

17:02:58 What was it like finding a place?

17:03:00 Uh… kind of frustrating, honestly. I was checking listings every day like Gumtree. Some places looked nice online but when I visit, not so much. One had like three people living in it already.

17:03:15 Did you have anything in mind when searching? Like, what was important to you?

17:03:19 Yeah, distance probably. I didn’t want to spend over an hour getting to campus. Safety was also important like, my parents kept telling me to avoid dodgy areas. And of course, the rent yeah I don't have that much budget.

17:03:33 Did you know much about the different suburbs before you moved?

17:03:35 Not really. I just searched best living areas near University of Melbourne or safe areas Melbourne and tried to read suggestions on forums. But it was confusing. Some people say one area is nice, others say it’s not safe at night.

17:03:49 Switching topics, when you start a new subject, how do you usually meet people in class?

17:03:53 Hm… it depends. If someone creates a group chat, I’ll join. Otherwise, I just kinda observe at first. I try to sit next to someone and say hi, but I’m not super outgoing. If we do group work, that helps a lot to know people.

17:04:09 Do you usually study with classmates?

17:04:11 Yeah, when I can. Last semester, I had a few people I worked with for stats. We meet at library and go through tutorials together. It helps, especially when the lecturer is too fast or the slides aren’t clear.

17:04:25 Do you have a favourite place to study?

17:04:27 Uh… ERC is solid. I like the graduate area in the second level, it’s quiet but not like silent, you know? Sometimes I go to the Alan Gilbert building too, Or if I want a chill spot, some café around my place.

17:04:42 How about socially, has it been easy or hard to make friends here?

17:04:45 A bit hard, honestly. I made some Korean friends through church. But with classmates, it’s a bit surface level sometimes. Everyone’s kinda busy. Like we say hi but don’t really hang out outside class.

17:05:00 What do you think makes it hard?

17:05:02 Mm… maybe the short semesters? By the time you start getting comfortable it’s already Week 8. Also I think international students and locals don’t always mix naturally. Different vibes, maybe. Not in a bad way, just… different.

17:05:19 When you’re choosing subjects, how do you usually decide?

17:05:22 First thing I do is message my senior people a year above. I ask them what subjects are useful, which ones are hard, or if the assignments are brutal. Then I ask at forums and look at subject outlines. But it’s still kind of a gamble.

17:05:38 Do you try to plan your degree around your future career?

17:05:41 Yeah, I try to. I want to work in data analytics or maybe machine learning so I try to pick the technical subjects. But sometimes I get confused like, should I choose the ones with more coding or more business context? Not always clear.

17:05:56 Have you ever struggled to know what subjects actually help with jobs?

17:06:00 Yeah, for sure. Like the subject names don’t always tell you what skills you’ll learn. And some descriptions are just very vague. I wish there were more real examples, like this subject helped me land a role at this company something like that.

17:06:15 Makes sense. What would help you feel more confident making decisions about your course?

17:06:19 Maybe like a subject map showing what topics lead to which kind of jobs. And honest reviews from students, not just this was fun but stuff like this subject is good if you want to get into data engineering that kind of thing.

17:06:34 That’s helpful. When it comes to platforms or websites for students, what makes you actually want to use them?

17:06:39 Honestly, if it’s easy to use and not overwhelming, I’ll use it. Also, if other students say it’s helpful, I’m more likely to try it.

17:06:53 What makes you stop using a site or app?

17:06:56 Hmm… if it’s too many clicks to find stuff. Or if it only works on desktop and not mobile because I usually check stuff on my phone. And yeah, if it feels like it’s made for admin, not students, I just stop.

17:07:12 Is there anything else you want to share before we wrap up?

17:07:15 Uh… maybe just that the first semester was the hardest. Like everything was new, systems, assignments, even just finding a good place to eat near campus. It gets better over time, but in the beginning, it’s easy to feel lost.

17:07:30 Yeah, totally. That’s really good insight. thanks so much for chatting today.

17:07:33 No problem, hope it helps
