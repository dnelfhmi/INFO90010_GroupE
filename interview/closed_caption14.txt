13:45:22 Hey, thanks again for joining today. This won’t take long, just a casual chat about your experience as an international student.

13:45:30 Yeah, no problem. Happy to talk.

13:45:33 Cool, before we dive in, anything you wanna ask first?

13:45:36 Uh, no, all good.

13:45:38 Awesome. So could you start by introducing yourself a little bit? Like what you study, what year you're in, where you're from?

13:45:44 Sure, um… I’m doing a Master of Computer Science, second semester now. I’m from Taiwan.

13:45:52 How’s the course going so far?

13:45:54 It's… okay I think? Pretty tough sometimes, especially with like assignments piling up, but I’m managing. First semester was harder because everything was new.

13:46:06 Yeah, I can imagine. And what’s your current living situation like?

13:46:10 I live in a apartment in Carlton with a friend. We split the rent. It’s small but convenient and I can walk to campus in like 10, 12 minutes.

13:46:24 Was it easy to find that place when you first arrived?

13:46:27 Uh… not really. When I first got here I didn’t know where to look. I stayed in an Airbnb for two weeks while I searched. I looked on Flatmates and Facebook, but it was super competitive. Some people never even replied.

13:46:43 That sounds frustrating.

13:46:45 Yeah, also I didn’t really know which suburbs were okay? Like, cheap doesn’t always mean good. I had to ask seniors and scroll through Reddit to get some idea.

13:46:58 What did you care about the most when picking a place?

13:47:01 Mainly rent, to be honest. But also like… I didn’t wanna live somewhere sketchy. And also I wanted to be near campus, I didn’t want to take the tram too much.

13:47:14 Yeah, fair enough. So switching to study, when you start a new subject, how do you usually connect with classmates?

13:47:21 Hmm… usually just talk during tutorials, or when we need to introduce ourself to people beside us on first day of class. Or sometimes there’s a subject Discord or WhatsApp for group assignment. But I don’t always find those, unless someone posts the link in LMS or during class.

13:47:35 Do you usually study alone or with others?

13:47:38 Mostly alone. It’s just easier. But I sometimes ask questions in group chats or Ed. I tried studying with classmates a few times, but finding the right people and matching schedules is kinda difficult.

13:47:54 Would you say it’s easy to meet others in the same subject?

13:47:58 Not really. I mean, unless you already know someone, it’s hard to like… just start a study group. Everyone’s busy or kinda in their own bubble.

13:48:10 Have you ever tried finding spaces to study with people?

13:48:13 Yeah, I use the library a lot. ERC or sometimes Baillieu. If I study with others, we try to get a group room but they get booked super fast. If there’s no space I just go to a quiet spot and use headphones.

13:48:28 Do you go to cafés or more public spots?

13:48:30 Not really. Too noisy. I get distracted easily. If I’m meeting a friend, maybe, but for serious study, I need like quiet space and a desk.

13:48:42 Has it been easy or hard to build friendships or academic networks?

13:48:46 Mmm, hard I think. Especially in CS, lots of people just come to class and leave. I have some Taiwanese friends and one or two I met through projects. But I wouldn’t say I have a big network or anything.

13:49:00 What gets in the way, do you think?

13:49:02 I guess just… everyone’s focused on assignments or part time jobs. And maybe language too, like, even if my English is okay, sometimes I feel shy or unsure if I’m saying things right.

13:49:17 Yeah that makes sense. So, how do you usually pick your subjects?

13:49:21 Honestly? I ask my seniors first. They tell me which subjects are heavy or have group work. Then I check the subject guide but sometimes it’s not detailed enough.

13:49:33 Do you try to plan your course around your career?

13:49:36 I try, but I’m not really sure what I wanna do yet. I think backend development maybe. I look at job ads and try to match the tech they want with subjects I can take, but it’s not that straightforward.

13:49:52 Is it clear which subjects help with which jobs?

13:49:55 Not really. Like sometimes it says “you’ll learn data structures” or something, but I don’t know how that connects to, like, industry stuff. It’s kinda abstract.

13:50:07 What kind of info would make it easier?

13:50:09 Maybe something that just… tells you what skills you learn and where people ended up after. Or if I could hear from someone who took it and already graduated, that’d help.

13:50:23 Last few questions, when you use uni-related platforms or websites, what makes you stick with them?

13:50:28 Hmm… if it’s not annoying. Like simple layout, not too many clicks. If I can find stuff fast. And if the info is actually useful and not just random announcements not related to me.

13:50:42 What would turn you off from using one?

13:50:44 Uh… too many pop ups, ads, or if it asks me to sign up just to see basic info. Or if it looks outdated, then I don’t trust it.

13:50:56 Alright, that’s it from me. Anything else you wanna add?

13:50:59 Hmm, I think that’s everything. Thanks for asking, it’s nice to reflect on this stuff.
