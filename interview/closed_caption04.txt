17:46:44 Recording is on. Thank you so much for agreeing to participate in our technological innovation study today.
17:46:53 My name is Daniel Fahmi and I'm conducting research as part of our team's project at the University of Melbourne.
17:46:59 The main aim of our project is to better understand the practical and social challenges international students face during their adjustment to life at the university.
17:47:08 And ultimately to explore the potential of designing a technological solution to address these challenges.
17:47:15 During the semi-structured interview. Which will approximately take 15 to 20 minutes. I will ask you some questions about your personal experience and your opinion on current technological tools. Also, we said that may support you.
17:47:30 There are no right or wrong answers. We are simply interested in your experiences, thoughts and insights.
17:47:36 You may choose to stop the interview at any point of time and your response will be kept confidential and used only for the purpose of research.
17:47:44 Do you have any question before we begin?
17:47:48 No, all good.
17:47:50 Okay, so to start with, can you please briefly introduce yourself?
17:47:56 Like year of study your and your country of origin.
17:48:02 I'm studying Master of Information Technology.
17:48:09 Specializing in cybersecurity. I'm originally from Indonesia.
17:48:18 Thank you. So could you share a bit about why you chose to study at the University of Melbourne out of all the cities in australia
17:48:32 The University of Melbourne. One of the top universities in australia I got adopted i got adopted When I applied to this uni.
17:48:46 Like yeah so i just followed it without… Trying other universities.
17:48:53 All right.
17:48:53 And I also… did some research on the research on subject that offered in my course and it is my interest to study and learn more about it.
17:49:12 Okay, that's cool. So how would you describe your experience so far as an international student at the University of Melbourne?
17:49:21 Sorry, inspiration. Or aspiration.
17:49:25 Your experience. Yes.
17:49:27 Experience. Being an international student, it's It's a bit challenging.
17:49:37 Mm-hmm.
17:49:37 For the first. Few months because it's really different 
17:49:46 Of course about the language as well because in indonesia mostly we use Bahasa Indonesia, Indonesian language.
17:49:54 Well, we are not actively use english in daily life. And after that because of Returning back.
17:50:06 Into uni after working for some years it's also difficult it's also difficult also to maintain the friendship as well.
17:50:20 Mm-hmm.
17:50:19 And it's because the difference of the cultures it's also a bit difficult.
17:50:27 Okay. Thank you. So could you give an example or share a specific situation that illustrates your experience?
17:50:38 For… example
17:50:48 When I have a friend like from a friend from Project.
17:50:57 Thank you.
17:50:55 Or a subject like we got some friends from that But profusely and during my uni years and bachelor's degree we .
17:51:09 It's easy for us to communicate or to meet up To… like hang out after that but in me here it is a bit difficult to do that I think it's more like they prefer to hang out more just for
17:51:31 To finalize the final assignment, something like that.
17:51:36 Yep, I totally got you. Yep.
17:51:41 So, okay, so… with regards to all the experience that you mentioned just now So… think about some of the expectation you had before arriving to Australia.
17:51:55 How have those match your actual experience?
17:52:00 Sorry, can you repeat that?
17:52:03 Uh like um it's your expectation match with your actual experiences
17:52:14 Mostly no. I expect a lot. I woke up.
17:52:20 It will be easy to gain friends like foreign friends but actually it is really hard because yeah it is difficult to maintain And… What else?
17:52:30 Mm-hmm.
17:52:35 Also joining some clubs, I think it will be easier because of you know a lot of assignments and everything it took a lot of our times we cannot really enjoy or joining like to be like to be make most of the time
17:52:59 Experience or join some events that being held by the clubs.
17:53:06 Yep. Okay. That's a very, very opinion.
17:53:12 So… Is there anything you wish you know before arriving to Australia?
17:53:19 Um…
17:53:24 Oh, wait, I need sometimes to think about that.
17:53:28 Thats alright, take your time.
17:53:34 I wish I knew that. It is difficult to find difficult an accommodation in here.
17:53:42 Oh, yeah. Okay.
17:53:45 And also that.
17:53:51 Master degree. It's very different from a bachelor degree and how difficult to You know?
17:54:03 Mm-hmm.
17:54:03 How difficult and different the way it's structured and delivered
17:54:12 Yep. Okay, interesting.
17:54:12 Compared to indonesia.
17:54:18 Um… Okay, so since arriving at the university of melbourne what practical or social challenges have you encountered?
17:54:34 Social challenges?
17:54:36 Mm-hmm.
17:54:41 I think you mentioned about making or be friends with people.
17:54:47 Yes.
17:54:48 Yeah, do you have any other social challenges that you have encountered or maybe you want to elaborate more on the on the interaction with friends.
17:54:58 Making friends.
17:55:01 I think it's more like you know the food.
17:55:06 We have like very different food culture back in indonesia and here Yeah, so I have to cook.
17:55:12 Yep, yep.
17:55:18 Okay.
17:55:18 To… So I can eat what I usually eat.
17:55:25 Back home so that's yeah one of the challenge And it's difficult as well to find like some ingredients in here.
17:55:29 I see.
17:55:35 Yep.
17:55:39 Okay, so… due to the difficulty of finding foods or maybe making friends with other people affect your daily life or studies
17:55:51 Hmm.
17:55:55 Two studies.
17:56:00 I think…
17:56:10 Thank you.
17:56:06 Of friends to discussion for a discussion i think it's Yeah, I have some friends for our discussion but Because we have like limitation to discuss about that we can discuss about design So yeah, it's a bit that challenge as well.
17:56:22 Mm-hmm.
17:56:28 Okay.
17:56:28 Because we want to you know like filing The rules.
17:56:35 Yep. Yep. Yeah, it's very good to maintain honesty throughout the study.
17:56:42 So it's very commendable. So, um.
17:56:42 Yeah.
17:56:46 How do you address our main dish? The challenges you mentioned just now.
17:57:05 Mm-hmm.
17:56:55 Yeah. For reference, I just try to keep communicating like trying to reach out first If I have time to meet up or to hang on. Yeah, I just skipped.
17:57:12 Cooking something that i have like i can found near me for discussion with friends.
17:57:20 So yeah, just keep reminding that There are rules to keep.
17:57:28 The honesty is that we don't violate that. Roles yeah just skip.
17:57:34 And try to consult with the lecturer or the tutor
17:57:42 Okay. Interesting so um Have you used any specific tools?
17:57:51 Apps, platforms, or services provided either by the university or from external sources to support you during your transition and adjustment.
17:58:06 The apps. Instagram, I used to force domain friendship From the uni.
17:58:14 Okay.
17:58:17 The emails Is that calling it? Like, mouse?
17:58:20 Okay. Mm-hmm.
17:58:24 Canvas, CAPS.
17:58:30 What else? I think it's all.
17:58:33 Okay. All right. So… Can you perhaps tell me about your experience using these tools also how effective were they?
17:58:54 Email sometimes can be effective because we have like the message his story in there.
17:59:06 In here. Her is like good work life balance that it doesn't exist in Indonesia.
17:59:15 Oh.
17:59:14 Oh yeah, this is also one of my challenge. But yeah, work life balance in Indonesia is actually non existent we usually reply to the message as soon as we can.
17:59:33 Oh.
17:59:33 If mostly most importantly if it's urgent but in here Almost…
17:59:44 Specifically during the break. Yeah, it's difficult to reach out to the lecturer like when we have the urgent question but we have to wait for them to reply to our message and also Um… when we inquire to stop one during with the
18:00:08 Message. It's also to… a long very long time for them to get back to us.
18:00:21 Yeah.
18:00:17 Yeah, yeah. Yep, I agree with your statement. So like um they really value their work-life balance with the highest value that they can put It's kind of beneficial for the worker.
18:00:32 But for consumer, it brings… a new challenges, I guess.
18:00:40 Yeah.
18:00:38 Yeah, I think it's it's good if they like you know can filter which one is the origin message?
18:00:48 Which one is starting to inquire and queries so yeah
18:00:55 Okay. Okay, so we have a few more questions.
18:01:02 Thinking about the challenges you have mentioned, in what ways do you think technology could potentially help you overcome or better manage these challenges?
18:01:14 The one that I just mentioned. If they can filter the urgent message.
18:01:17 Okay.
18:01:23 Okay, filtering the message. Okay.
18:01:25 Yeah, that can modify. The lecturer of the Stop one.
18:01:30 Yep. Mm-hmm.
18:01:34 Aging yeah
18:01:36 Okay. So in your opinion, what would make a technological tool appealing or valuable to international student libraries?
18:01:49 Sorry, can you repeat that?
18:01:51 Okay, what features or what would make a technological tool appealing or valuable to international students to use.
18:02:05 Oh. Feature i think live chat there is no live chat from the stop one as well.
18:02:16 Okay.
18:02:17 I think that would be beneficial if the future for the urgent message cannot be applied.
18:02:33 Yes.
18:02:28 And also for caps as well you know capsule the consult yeah surfaces there is like you know when you have like emergency you have to call or something but sometimes you cannot speak right during envision this situation you don't want to speak at all.
18:02:49 But you just want to… Yeah, you know, the brain like malfunctioning and you just want you just want to target because you don't want to spake
18:03:04 Okay, yeah.
18:03:05 What caps is right now he's just using message i i message something like that.
18:03:12 So yeah, life chat will be beneficial.
18:03:17 Okay, yeah, considering the degree of severity of the issue that you just mentioned, I think it's totally valid to have a live chat And this is not something that um we can intentionally delay you know what i'm saying like
18:03:34 Yeah, yeah.
18:03:36 Yeah um yeah because it's these things need to be addressed as soon as possible And yeah.
18:03:43 I think, yeah, I totally agree with you.
18:03:49 Okay, so… That's all. Thank you very much for your valuable insights and your time today.
18:03:53 Oh. Yeah, I hope we can help mute.
18:03:57 So here Yeah.
18:04:01 Your responses have given us a clearer picture of the practical and social challenges faced by international students.
18:04:09 As well as your experience and preferences regarding technological support. As mentioned earlier.
18:04:16 Your information will be kept completely confidential and used solely for the purpose of this research project.

18:04:31 So before we conclude, do you have any question for me about our research or this interview process?
18:04:32 Okay.
18:04:39 What are you going to make actually or is it going to be decided based on the results of the research?
18:04:55 Mm-hmm.
18:04:47 Okay, so we do have you prototype, I would say, or solutions initial solution that we have in our mind But we need your valuable insights as well as your experience to guide us who is the development of the prototype we're designing the prototype.
18:05:10 So… our prototype our product will be very user-centric.
18:05:18 So we are now collecting data And we have interviewed a few peoples like you are maybe number four, number five So using all the gated data we will then start designing our our product so the product will be a digital
18:05:38 It would be a digital solution. Targeting to making social integration For the international student easier in australia
18:05:53 That's cool.
18:05:56 Yes. So it is for subject uh info90010.
18:06:05 Technology innovation.
18:06:10 All right.
18:06:14 I know.
18:06:12 Do you have more questions? I'm happy to answer okay Okay, so thank you once again for your participation. Your input is highly appreciated and will help us develop meaningful innovation to support international students here at the University of Melbourne.
