16:42:11 Thanks again for joining today. Just to get started, could you briefly introduce yourself? Like your course, year of study, and where you're from?
16:42:18 Uh, yeah sure. I'm doing Master of Electrical Engineering, currently in my second semester. I’m from Malaysia.
16:42:25 Great, thanks. What made you choose the University of Melbourne?
16:42:30 I guess a few reasons. The uni reputation, mainly. Also, I had a couple of seniors who came here, and they said the program is solid and the facilities are good. So yeah, that helped.
16:42:42 How has your experience been so far as an international student here?
16:42:46 Uh, honestly it's been kind of a mixed. Some parts have been really good, but others yeah challenging.
16:42:53 Can you give an example maybe? Something specific that stood out?
16:42:57 Yeah sure. So like, my undergrad was in the US, so the academic system is quite different and I have to spend some time adjusting my approach to assignments and exams here.
16:43:08 Like they put a lot of weight in exams here and I have to adjust for that. It wasn’t really like that before, in the US it was more balanced I guess.
16:43:19 I see. Did you have certain expectations before arriving that didn’t quite match the reality?
16:43:25 Oh yeah. Like with housing, for example. I assumed I could just find a place in a couple weeks. But nope, student accommodations, either outside or university’s, are more expensive and filled up very fast, and I think Master students generally don’t prefer those places so it’s hard to make decisions.
16:43:41 Yeah, housing seems to be a big issue for many. Where did you end up staying?
16:43:45 I’m renting a room in a shared apartment in Carlton now. Took some time to find, and I had to rely on a friend here who helped me connect with someone moving out.
16:43:55 What was that process like for you?
16:43:57 Pretty stressful, honestly. Like, I was juggling that while trying to get used to my subjects, and everything was happening at once.
16:44:06 That sounds like a lot. Aside from housing, have there been other practical or social challenges?
16:44:11 I think the main one is just time. The pressure of keeping up with the subject content and assignments keeps me occupied most of the time.
16:44:22 So do you find it hard to, say, participate in campus life or events?
16:44:26 Yeah, definitely. There are some interesting career-related events each semester, but I couldn’t find the time to attend. Like, they sound good in theory, but they always clash with my class or assignments or I just feel too tired.
16:44:39 Yeah, that’s very relatable. How do you currently deal with these challenges, like managing time or finding help when you're stuck?
16:44:47 I try to keep track using calendars and to-do lists, but it doesn’t always work. I usually go on Ed I think Ed is a pretty nice platform for students to interact with each other and the teaching staffs, academically but you still need to wait for the responses especially when it’s the weekend.
16:45:01 Right, so there’s a bit of delay?
16:45:03 Yeah, exactly. Sometimes I post a question and then wait half a day or more. It’s better than nothing, but I wish there was a faster way.
16:45:12 Do you use any other tools or services either from the uni or outside?
16:45:17 I use the LMS of course, and sometimes LinkedIn for career stuff. But honestly, I’m not exploring much beyond that because of time.
16:45:26 Understood. If you think about the main challenges you mentioned, housing, academic adjustment, time pressure. In what ways do you think technology could help you more?
16:45:36 Maybe like a better overview tool? Something that helps me compare housing options easily, or shows subject planning in a more personalised way.
16:45:52 Yeah? Like a hub for both academic and future planning?
16:45:55 Yeah, exactly. I feel like everything’s so scattered right now. 
16:46:07 And what would make you actually want to use a tool like that? Like what would make it feel worth your time?
16:46:14 I guess... it needs to be really intuitive. And not full of jargon. Just something that works. Like I want it to show relevant info quickly. If I have to navigate through ten tabs, I’ll probably just give up.
16:46:28 Makes sense. And how about support or interaction with other students, do you wish there was more of that?
16:46:35 I mean I know there are some Discord groups and stuff, but it's very informal. If there was a proper space where students could discuss things openly or even just share tips, that'd be nice.
16:46:47 Something less formal than a course forum, but still focused.
16:46:51 Yeah exactly. Like peer-to-peer help. Sometimes I learn more from classmates than lecturers anyway.
16:47:00 Thank you, this is very helpful. Just before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to share that we haven’t covered yet?
16:47:18 And before we end, do you have any questions for me?
16:47:23 No, I think I’m good.
16:47:25 Alright. Thanks again for your time and your insights today.
16:47:30 Yeah, no worries. Happy to help.
