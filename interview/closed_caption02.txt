17:20:58 All right. Thank you so much for agreeing to participate in our technology innovation study today.
17:21:03 My name is Daniel Fahmi and I'm conducting research as part of our team's project at the University of Melbourne.
17:21:10 The main aim of our project is to better understand the practical and social challenges international students face during their adjustment to life at the university.
17:21:18 And ultimately, to explore the potential of designing a technological solution to address these challenges.
17:21:24 During the semi-structured interview, which will take approximately 15 to 20 minutes I will ask you some question about your personal experiences and your opinions on current technological tools or services that may support you as an international student. 
17:21:39 Just to remind you, there are no right or wrong answers. We are simply interested in your honest experience, thoughts and insights.
17:21:49 You may choose to stop the interview at any point of time and your responses will be kept confidential and used only for the purpose of our research.
17:21:59 Yep, we can proceed now.
17:21:57 Do you have any questions before we begin? Okay, thank you. So can you please briefly introduce yourself like um your year of study your course and your country of origin uh without having to say your name.
17:22:14 Yep. Thank you for having me for this interview. So I went to university of melbourne.
17:22:19 So I did a Bachelor of Science and majored in biotechnology Then I also proceeded to do my honors and also my doctoral studies in cancer biology.
17:22:32 And your country of origin.
17:22:35 And I came from Malaysia.
17:22:38 Okay. So could you share a bit about why you chose to study at the University of Melbourne?
17:22:47 Yep. So at the time when I was picking my course, I wanted to do science.
17:22:52 When I was looking at the university ranking, the University of Melbourne came out on top And we know that University of Melbourne have the best facilities for scientific research in Australia. It's surrounded by multiple hospitals, which are well renowned.
17:23:05 And I know that you can provide me with the best trainings to become a good researcher at the time.
17:23:16 Yeah, 100%.
17:23:21 Yes. Awesome.
17:23:11 Yeah, I agree with that. It's also part of the Go 8 university which is the collaboration of a world-renowned universities in the australia good choice Awesome. So how would you describe your previous experience as an international student at the University of Melbourne?
17:23:30 Yep. Well, When I first came to Australia to study at the University of Melbourne.
17:23:38 Inevitably like lots of students, especially coming from international background there was some challenges, as you can imagine, right?
17:23:46 The first three to four months, the main challenge was the English language So it wasn't like I didn't know the language, but it's part of adapting to the accent and some terms that the locals use, right? So at the time, the biggest struggle was trying to understand
17:23:59 Yes.
17:24:03 How people speak and how to understand them properly in a sense that you know they would want to have a normal conversation with you And also discussion in classes, also listening to lectures and doing practicals.
17:24:15 So that was quite the experience in trying to understand everything together for the early periods.
17:24:21 And there were also some of the challenges of being a student like by management, handling stress and anxiety of, you know, integrating into new cultures in australia
17:24:33 Understood. So, um. Could you perhaps give an example or share a specific situation on any of the experience that you just uh tell me that illustrate your experience here.
17:24:44 Yep. Yep. I would say at the time being an international student, as you can imagine, we were outnumbered by the local students, right?
17:24:56 Mm-hmm.
17:24:55 So inevitably there was some anxiety of trying to fit in with other people of the same background, whereas you coming from Malaysia or you know vietnam or whatever you're going to have some differences between them, right?
17:25:08 Mm-hmm.
17:25:07 So at the time, the only way to overcome it really was to you know uh put on a brief face and try to integrate and talk to them better.
17:25:17 And try to pay more attention to the conversations, try to understand the terms that we use together in that conversation.
17:25:24 For lectures When I struggle to understand what was trying to be conveyed by the lecturers I would go to the lecturers and try to ask them to clarify what they mean when they teach something to be.
17:25:45 Yeah.
17:25:39 In tutorial classes as you can imagine it's an interactive experience right um You know, students ask a lot more questions and the tutors will come to your tables and ask you know oh do you need any support any guidance so that was better, that was more interactive and helpful
17:25:55 In practical classes, at times it can be a bit of a struggle.
17:26:00 But for me, with the helps of actually further to that actually with other international students It actually helped me to integrate better into the situation.
17:26:11 Yep.
17:26:12 Nice. Such a nice experience so um Another question is thinking about some of the expectations that you had before arriving here the one that you had in malaysia.
17:26:25 How have this matched your actual experience once you have arrived in Australia?
17:26:26 Mm-hmm.
17:26:31 Yep. Before coming to australia I actually thought that things would be smooth in terms of, like I said, integrating understanding things together with the students as well as the lecturers.
17:26:44 So I would say the expectation did not quite match what I was expecting in the first place.
17:26:50 But yeah, in the end, it was all a good learning experience It was all a good learning experience. And yeah, after a few years in uni i think i managed to integrate well and then learns a few items there, neither here nor there.
17:27:08 Altogether, I think it was definitely a self-improvement experience. I think it was facilitated by Unimelb themselves.
17:27:17 So obviously there were some courses that offer support for students. So I remember when I first joined, there's this, I think it was something like conversational classes.
17:27:29 Okay.
17:27:28 So I think, yeah, it was kind of like a two weeks orientation course and then you know they inducted us international students and then the sort of bring us together and then explain some, oh, for instance, Australians, they like to like shorter term so like for afternoon avo
17:27:44 So I thought that was a really, really helpful experience for me to adapt.
17:27:48 Yeah. Okay. Glad to know that.
17:27:49 Yeah.
17:27:54 Is there anything you wish you know? Before arriving?
17:27:58 Yeah, good question. Well, for me, um, for me I wish I would have been told that there was a bit of a hybrid form of classes. So coming from Malaysia at the time, it was all face-to-face classes, right?
17:28:14 So when I first came to the University of Melbourne, it was actually a hybrid mode where lectures were recorded.
17:28:21 And one can choose not to attend a class themselves, right? So you can choose to just watch the lectures from home.
17:28:26 Yeah.
17:28:28 Because I think one thing that I will admit is that, again, going back to the struggle with English.
17:28:34 When I go to lectures, actually watch them live, I tend to struggle to keep up with the piece of what's presented, right?
17:28:42 So if I hadn't known that the lectures were recorded, I would just not bother attending the lectures and elicit the recordings.
17:28:50 Where I can slow down the presentation and try to understand things bit by bit according to my own piece. Does that make sense?
17:28:58 Yep.
17:29:05 Yep. Mm-hmm.
17:28:57 Yeah, yes, yes. That's an interesting take from you. Some of the students prefer especially the local students Some of them prefer to attend live lecture because they can have interactive session with the lecturer But I kind of agree with
17:29:14 many of the international students, they prefer to watch lecture recording more because you can have uh you can learn at your own pace So that's a nice input.
17:29:19 Yes. That's it.
17:29:23 Yeah. And if you have any questions, I mean, you could just shoot them an email, right? So it's not like you can't get enough support of anything.
17:29:31 So yeah.
17:29:29 Yes. Yes. May I know if your semester run during COVID-19.
17:29:36 Yep.
17:29:40 Times or it's prior to COVID-19?
17:29:43 Yep. For me, it was before the COVID times.
17:29:46 Okay, cool. All right, so… Moving on to the next question.
17:29:52 Since arriving at the University of Melbourne, what practical or social challenges have you encountered?
17:29:59 So… Yep.
17:29:59 Yeah. Please go ahead.
17:30:04 Yep so practical or social challenges um I would say the most obvious one is cultural differences. Like I said.
17:30:14 The local students, they have their own interests as compared from an Asian like me, right? So for instance, I remember after on Fridays, actually on Friday evenings.
17:30:26 They would invite me to go out to a bar and go out for drinks, right? You know, in like a pub or something to celebrate the week or just hang out together.
17:30:32 Okay.
17:30:40 Yes.
17:30:36 But it's not really the thing where I came from, right? So because obviously this involvement of alcohol, that's involvement of partying and um i was yeah i was just not you know into those kind of things but um I guess at the time with effort of trying to fit in and being accepted
17:30:53 I still ended up going to those events, but obviously I did not cross any critical lines that would have gotten me into any troubles.
17:31:02 So yeah, so I guess that's one of the challenges of me tried to fit in into the culture Practical challenges.
17:31:24 Hmm. Yep.
17:31:12 What else? What else? I guess it's more like There were lots of assignments where we would be required to do a class presentation, right? You know, speaking in front of people so I don't think I was trained that well when I was in Malaysia like so my soft skills of presenting clearly in front of people
17:31:32 It wasn't that smooth at that time. So I think that's the one thing that I wish I'd have known better and I sort of gained that skill over time by joining the University of Melbourne, because I think I was required to do a lot of presentations throughout my undergrad as well as my doctoral studies as well.
17:31:50 Yep.
17:31:51 Okay. Okay. Interesting. So did any of these challenges affect your daily life or studies?
17:31:58 Yep. These challenges after like, it's definitely a good learning experience so definitely it sort of shaped me as a person as well Like I said, in terms of the ability to do speeches, the ability to do presentations, it helped me develop my soft skills and I managed to connect with people better.
17:32:21 Going to especially like networking events or presenting in scientific conferences right So those kind of skills of being able to chat to people, being able to make them understand you clearly it's imperative to connect with them, right? So overall, definitely there's some improvement of me as a person
17:32:42 In my career as well as my learning from all those experiences from studying at University Melbourne.
17:32:57 Yep.
17:32:51 Okay, so… Could you describe some resources or services you have used to overcome these challenges. It could be external resources or university provided resources or services.
17:33:06 Yeah. One of the more useful platform for me at that time was actually from YouTube.
17:33:13 So I used to watch a lot of what they call Tedtalk. So TED Talks is simply like an amalgamation or collection of people giving speech deliveries about multiple issues around the world.
17:33:27 So what I did was I watched those videos and I sort of learned from them on how to speak clearly how to understand people better, right?
17:33:38 Mm-hmm.
17:33:57 Mm-hmm.
17:33:38 So that was a good uh support So from the university, for me, when I was doing my doctoral studies, I was trained by my supervisor So before I had to do any conference presentation we need some sort of a practice right so sort of me just me and him. So I would just go through the PowerPoint and do the speech in front of him
17:34:02 And that tremendously improved my public speaking skills. The other thing was definitely going to going to networking sessions.
17:34:15 So, I mean, all those little small talks, all those professional conversations That definitely helped me as well.
17:34:32 Yep. Yep. Yep.
17:34:22 Okay. So if I get you correctly so you mentioned about youtube also um youtube specifically on the tech talks uh channels And then a networking session So, yep, that's all the resources and services that you had used. And I believe it's not uh
17:34:42 It's not an exhaustive list you might have some other resources that you have used But the one that you mentioned is the most use, yes?
17:34:51 Yep, yep. Correct.
17:34:53 Okay, okay. Can you tell me more about your experience using these resources? 
17:35:06 Yeah, for sure. Like I said, for instance, going back to the YouTube and tech talks i think As you can imagine, the people presenting in those YouTubes, they're like professionals and highly skilled people.
17:35:20 So modeling after them greatly improved my own skills And yeah, so I think… As for me going into classes doing practical presentations.
17:35:35 It's a good way to improve myself and then Yep.
17:35:43 All good. Hmm.
17:35:40 Okay. Okay, thank you. So I would like to explore more on the um technological tools.
17:35:48 Yep, yep.
17:35:49 Do you think technology could potentially help you overcome or better manage these challenges?
17:36:23 Yeah, for sure. Definitely there are some good highly skilled individuals running those platforms to help students thrive in their studies, right?
17:36:33 But for me, I haven't been using most of those technologies at that time actually because um I'm not sure if they were thoroughly available during my time when I was doing my undergrad.
17:36:46 So I don't think I can comment that much on that matter.
17:36:50 Okay, that's all right. So.
17:36:55 In what ways do you think technology could potentially help you 
17:37:07 Yep, I guess, yeah, I actually had thought of something so i guess um I want to go back to the discussion about the struggles of understanding the accent of Australian English, right?
17:37:29 Mm-hmm.
17:37:19 Now, I remember, you know, like I mentioned earlier, I remember like watching recordings instead of attending lectures right So one thing that I can think of is that perhaps there could be an integration of doing live transcriptions You know, like in YouTube, right? When you watch a video, the system can create like a live transcript like oh um
17:37:40 Yeah.
17:37:44 Sort of spelling out what the speaker is saying, right? So I can see that being a powerful tool to help the international students understand what's being delivered, right?
17:37:52 Oh, okay. Mm-hmm.
17:37:53 So you imagine, you know, listening to the sorry watching the lecture in a lecture theater life And the screen behind showing the transcripts, almost like a subtitles of watching a YouTube video, right?
17:38:06 Mm-hmm.
17:38:04 So I feel like that's going to be a powerful tool to have the international students adapt well to the system here.
17:38:14 Yes. Yep, I agree. So I believe you are explaining or describing about captioning, which is just like we had in the interview here right.
17:38:25 Oh, really? Okay.
17:38:29 Okay.
17:38:25 Yeah. That's a good idea Having this live transcriptions definitely can help students manage their time because it saves their time and it could overcome the accent problem.
17:38:45 Yep, indeed.
17:38:46 Lecturers come from diverse background, not only from australia So that is a really helpful 
17:38:54 Yep.
17:38:56 Yeah, so in your opinion. What would make a technological tool appealing or valuable to international students like yourself?
17:39:07 Yep. So I think… Probably number one is user friendly So if I want to teach myself to use an app or whatever website to help me I want to make sure that I can use it easily right so um and also perhaps a good tutorial
17:39:27 That's thorough and easy to understand right so you imagine being in uni, you already have to learn a lot of things. And the last thing I want is to struggle to understand what's supposed to be the platform that helps me to manage my studies here in University Melbourne.
17:39:45 Yeah, I think that's about it, I think. Maybe… In terms of I guess in terms of the application of the technology, no, I don't think I have anything else. Yeah, that's it.
17:40:01 Thank you. Just all right. So, okay.
17:40:08 Thank you very much for your valuable insights and your time today.
17:40:15 Thank you.
