14:07:33 I'll start the recording now.
14:07:41 Okay, recording started.
14:07:47 All right. So… Thank you so much for agreeing to participate in our technology innovation study today.
14:07:54 My name is Daniel Fahmi and I'm conducting research as part of our team's project at the University of Melbourne.
14:08:01 The main aim of our project is to better understand the practical and social challenges international students international student face during the adjustment to life at the university and ultimately to explore the potential of designing a technological solution to address these challenges.
14:08:21 During this semi-structured interview which will approximately takes 15 to 20 minutes I will ask you some question about your personal experiences your opinions on current technological tools or services that may support you as an international student.
14:08:39 There are no right or wrong answers. We are simply interested in your experience, thoughts and insights.
14:08:40 Hmm.
14:08:45 You may choose to stop the interview at any point of time.
14:08:48 You are not forced to answer any question and your response will be kept confidential and used only for the purpose of our research.
14:08:56 So before I start, do we have any question? No question. Thank you.
14:09:00 No question.
14:09:05 So we'll have a little warm up or background questions before we go to the uh interview related questions. So can you please briefly introduce yourself? You don't have to tell your name just maybe your year of study and when did you study in uni
14:09:22 What course you took your country of origin it can be really brief.
14:09:27 Okay, without telling my name, I did my study in University of Melbourne from 2018 to 2020.
14:09:35 I did Bachelor of Science, major in biotech. And nutrition. I came from Malaysia. Now I'm working here.
14:09:42 In Melbourne.
14:09:46 Okay. Thank you so much. All right.
14:09:50 Could you share a bit about the reason why you choose to study at the University of Melbourne.
14:09:56 What makes you want to study in the city of melbourne out of thousands of universities out there
14:10:02 First of all, I was sponsored by my by the government of Malaysia to further my study overseas And firstly, I chose Melbourne because especially University of Melbourne because he was number one uni in australia especially they are really good in uh for scientific research
14:10:22 And stuff like that.
14:10:25 Okay, so because of the ranking as well as the well-reputed research Okay, thank you.
14:10:30 Yeah.
14:10:35 So how would you describe your experience so far as an international student at the University of Melbourne?
14:10:43 To be honest, I felt very welcomed. The local students there they are uh very friendly australians are very friendly anyways but they welcome us international student to join their group to let's say if we have some meeting or anything they don't separate the international students and local students
14:11:11 All right. Thank you. So… could you give an example or share a specific situation that illustrates your experience like um you feel very welcome. Is there any experience that you want to share, you would like to share to me?
14:11:28 Yep. So because I did science right so basically we have Many… lab experiments that we have to do.
14:11:39 Mm-hmm.
14:11:38 And for us international students some of us we are not very familiar with the lab Many of us came from developing countries so we are not so used to the technology that they use in the in the lab.
14:11:51 So these local students they were very helpful they helped us to handle all these apprentices, to handle all these software that they already use when they are in high school i guess so and our duty also they are very
14:12:09 Very friendly as well very welcoming us. To ask any question that we don't know.
14:12:16 Okay. Thank you. So given your experience how have your expectations match your actual experience before you arrive here?
14:12:35 Yeah, I initially, Australia is the first country I've ever been overseas.
14:12:43 And I don't know much about Australia because I don't really watch, you know, Aussie movies or Aussie series or anything.
14:12:49 So I thought Aussie people they are uh more guarded they don't really open up themselves but yeah surprisingly they are I think one of the most friendliest people I've ever met.
14:13:03 Very happy. Yeah.
14:13:05 You're very happy with it. And it's matched with your expectation or maybe beyond expectation. Do you agree?
14:13:13 Beyond my expectation, I will say yeah
14:13:14 All right. Thank you. So moving on.
14:13:18 Thank you.
14:13:21 So since arriving at the University of Melbourne what practical or social challenges have you encountered?
14:13:31 Sorry can you repeat?
14:13:30 Have you encounter any… practical or social challenges during your time as an international student when you first come to the University of Melbourne.
14:13:41 Any challenges regarding to the social and practical issues.
14:13:42 Yep. Social yeah I would say maybe one of the issue is I am a practicing Muslim.
14:13:51 Most of the time like for muslims we have to do our friday prayers right around one to two o'clock.
14:13:58 Every Friday we have to do that. And here basically the university didn't really have specific timetable where the Muslim students they can skip the classes to go to pray.
14:14:13 From 1 to 2 p.m. Just to take our prayer. So I think that's if I would say social challenges is that there are a few compulsory classes that we have to pick And I had to skip few few weeks I had to skip my Friday prayers because uh
14:14:29 I have to attend those classes especially lab la experiment class. Yep.
14:14:37 Okay, thank you. All right.
14:14:42 How do you address or manage those challenges like the Friday prayer you mentioned Do you use any resources or services?
14:14:51 Yeah, so for Yeah, so first thing first obviously i informed my supervisor about that some of them they can locate us to different classes a different day although those sessions are full they managed to put us into those classes because
14:15:15 This is not something that we simply we just want to change class
14:15:25 Mm-hmm.
14:15:23 Very happy for that but certain classes for example they only have only one compulsory tutorial subjects to take for the class that we have to attend only on Friday.
14:15:36 So during that situation there's nothing that they can do and also I cannot do anything about it.
14:15:41 Okay, understood. All right. So, um.
14:15:46 Have you used any specific tools, apps, platform or services, maybe like scheduling tools provided by University of Melbourne?
14:15:54 Or any other external sources to support you during your transition and adjustment as the international student in the university.
14:16:04 As international student, I am very grateful with the timetable sorting software that they use i don't know the exact name of the software
14:16:16 Mm-hmm.
14:16:16 Basically they have all these options of classes that we can choose and basically from there for me No, I… If possible, I want to avoid coming to class on Friday, especially Friday noon Yeah, very helpful those uh those software.
14:16:35 Okay, thank you for your response and then uh So moving to the technological opportunities so in what way you think the technology that you have used or you thinking of using it could potentially help you overcome or manage these challenges.
14:16:55 Yeah.
14:16:57 Can you please explain more on that maybe some examples?
14:17:02 So like um Do you think this kind of technology is appealing or valuable to international students like yourself?
14:17:13 Oh yeah, I would say it is very, very helpful, very appealing.
14:17:14 Mm-hmm.
14:17:18 Because especially we international students we don't really know what time class starts and some live far away so basically if we can see like all of the classes there we can see all the classes available there. Okay, started at six, started seven, started eight.
14:17:33 And what time usually it ends it is very helpful for us to manage our time as well. And I think many of the students also oh no just for me I am quite lucky because I stay just 10 minutes walk from the uni.
14:17:48 So I don't have any issue on that but few of my friends they had to travel like one hour two hour just to attend a class.
14:17:56 Mm-hmm.
14:17:56 So having this technology is very helpful, very, very helpful.
14:18:01 Okay. Okay. Thank you. So… Could you describe features or services you wish existed but currently do not?
14:18:13 Like any kind of technology that tools that you wish it existed so that it can be really helpful for you.
14:18:22 Related to this scenario or does not matter?
14:18:25 Doesn't matter maybe more towards like your life as international student solving your struggles as an international student yeah
14:18:35 Oh, yeah. I think… one of the issue as international students as a whole is to
14:18:46 Let's say we want to rent a house basically we want to know who's our housemates are So… basically if there are some tools where if us we can filter out what kind of housemates that we want let's say I want boys only and also maybe i want
14:19:11 Mm-hmm.
14:19:08 Practicing Muslim only no alcohol, so if you can have that kind of tools to assist us in that situation.
14:19:19 Especially for us international student we come here we don't know many people at the start. So I think that would be very helpful.
14:19:26 In the future as well.
14:19:28 Okay. Thank you very much for your valuable insights and your time today. Your response have given us a clearer picture of the practical and social challenges.
14:19:38 Faced by international students as well as your experience and preferences regarding the technological support.
14:19:45 So as I mentioned earlier, your information will be kept completely confidential and used solely for the purpose of this research project only.
14:19:52 So if you have any additional comments, thoughts or suggestions after today's interview.
14:19:56 Please feel free to contact me. Via email, the Zoom email that provided.
14:20:03 So before we conclude, do you have any question for me about our research or this interview process?
14:20:11 Is it possible for us to, how should i say be once after the research finished right you guys going to post the paper or anything Is it possible for us to… to read the paper or maybe like get some updates from you guys regarding the research
14:21:29 Yes, absolutely. I will keep in touch on you regarding the development of the product that we are developing.
14:21:35 Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much for that.
14:21:40 All right. Thank you once again for your participation. Your input is highly appreciated and will help us develop meaningful innovation to support international students here at the University of Melbourne.
