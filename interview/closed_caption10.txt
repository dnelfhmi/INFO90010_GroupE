16:00:15 I will go ahead and start the recording now.
16:00:19 Sure.

16:00:23 Thank you again for being here. As a quick refresher, this is part of a research project at the University of Melbourne where we are trying to better understand how international students adapt, especially in terms of study, housing, and social life, and explore ways that technology tools could better support that journey. Today is all about your personal experiences. Does that sound okay?

16:00:43 Yes, of course. Happy to share.

16:00:46 Great. So, to start off, can you tell me a little about yourself? Just your course, year, and where you are from?

16:00:53 I am from Colombia. I arrived in Melbourne in July last year, so it has been almost a year now. I am studying Master of International Relations, currently in my second semester.

16:01:07 Nice. And where are you staying now?

16:01:10 I am renting a room in a shared house in Brunswick. It is actually a big old house with four other international students. Some from Italy, Vietnam, and one from Malaysia. It is a bit chaotic sometimes, but honestly, it has been a blessing. I cannot imagine living alone right now.

16:01:28 That sounds like a great mix. How was it when you first arrived? Was it easy to find that place?

16:01:34 Not at all. I arrived with one suitcase and no plan. I booked an Airbnb for two weeks and just started visiting as many inspections as I could. I found that most places were already taken or had twenty people lining up. I was lucky to meet one of my current housemates through one of Facebook groups.

16:01:53 Wow. Did you know what suburbs to look at? Or was it random?

16:01:58 Totally random at first. I just looked for cheap rent and places with tram lines. I did not really understand which areas were safe or good for students. Now I really like Brunswick because of the community vibe and the cafes. But it was trial and error.

16:02:14 If there had been a platform that showed you suburb details, like rent ranges, how diverse the area is, if there are student houses nearby, or even if people from your country tend to live there, would that have helped?

16:02:29 That would have been amazing. Especially the cultural vibe part. I did not know where to find Latin groceries, or which suburbs felt more inclusive. And yes, just knowing if a place is quiet or sketchy at night would have helped a lot.

16:02:48 Let us shift to studying. When you start a new subject, how do you usually find people to study with, if you do?

16:02:56 To be honest… I try to talk to people in tutorials, but it is hard. Everyone already seems to know someone, or they rush out after class.. I do not really have a steady group.

16:03:13 Would it help if there was a tool that let you find classmates based on shared interests or study habits? Like people open to casual study sessions or discussion?

16:03:23 Well I would love that. Like if we could know “hey, five other people from your subject are going to study in the Baillieu Library at 4 PM”, I would definitely show up. Sometimes you just need someone around, even if you are not talking the whole time.

16:03:40 Would you prefer it to be more structured, like booking time with people, or something more flexible?

16:03:46 Definitely flexible. I think more like… drop-in study buddies.

16:04:03 Got it. What about spaces to study? Do you have favorites?

16:04:07 I like the cafe when it is not too crowded. But yes, it is hard to find quiet spots during exam period

16:04:24 What if there was a real-time map that showed how full or quiet different study spaces are?

16:04:31 That would be so helpful. Maybe even places that are open late. I always study better after dinner but most of the places in Melbourne close early.

16:04:47 Now let us talk about academic planning. How do you choose your subjects?

16:04:51 Oh, it is confusing. I mostly go by what is compulsory and then ask seniors for advice. But there is not much clarity about what subjects actually help you land a job. I wish someone just told tips or tricks or ways to get more info about the subjects that i am taking.

16:05:09 Would a planner tool that shows how subjects connect to job roles, and includes student reviews or workload estimates, be helpful?

16:05:19 Absolutely. Especially if it comes from real students and not just the handbook. I remember one subject was described as introductory but it turns outr to be full-on political theory with 300 pages of reading.

16:05:37 When you use platforms designed for students, what do you look for?

16:05:42 Ease of use. I do not want to read a manual just to find my timetable. Like maybe it suggests events that actually match my interests, not just random faculty emails.

16:05:57 What would make you stop using something?

16:05:59 Too many notifications. Or if it tries too hard to be cool and ends up being messy. I am not there for the badges or avatars.

16:06:10 If we designed a platform specifically for international students, what is something we should avoid?

16:06:16 Do not make everything about being an international student. But also, give us things that do matter like mental health tips, rent advice, even just how to email a professor without sounding rude because of my language barriers.

16:06:35 What is one thing you wish existed that does not right now?

16:06:39 Hmm… Maybe a community board that is half tech, half human. Like where students can share study tips, post meetups, or ask questions without fear of judgment. Sort of like Reddit, but for our university.

16:06:55 Nice maybe like a university specific version of Reddit?

16:06:59 Exactly. Safe, useful, and welcoming.

16:07:03 Before we wrap up, have you used any tech that has genuinely helped with your student life?

16:07:08 Honestly probably discord servers for subjects. But I still feel like nothing centralizes everything. I would love one tool that combines support resources, and maybe even a gentle nudge to reach out to you, i dont know how to say it but i hope you got the idea.

16:07:27 Like a digital companion that checks in?

16:07:29 Yes, exactly. Not just “submit your assignment,” but “Hey, how are you doing today?”

16:07:35 That is beautiful. Thanks so much. Thas been really insightful.

16:07:42 No worries and I hope so. It is not always easy here.

16:07:51 Absolutely. Thanks again and good luck with the semester!
